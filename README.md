## ðŸš€ About Me

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhisheknaiidu/abhisheknaiidu/master/code.gif" width="300" height="400" />

I'm a beginner programmer currently learning C++ and exploring the world of software development.

Right now, I'm discovering different areas like Web Development, Game Development, and especially Mobile Applications. While I'm still deciding between cross-platform (Flutter) and native Android (Java/Kotlin), my focus is leaning toward building real Android apps and understanding mobile development more deeply.

Since iOS isn't a priority for now, I'm mostly experimenting with tools and approaches that suit Android.

My goal is to keep learning, build useful mobile apps, and eventually find the best path that fits me â€” whether that's cross-platform or native.
